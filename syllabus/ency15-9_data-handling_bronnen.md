> How do we navigate and interact with massive cultural collections (billions of objects)? How do we combine close reading of individual artifacts and “distant reading” of patterns across millions of these artifacts? What visualization and computational tools are particularly suited for working with large cultural data sets? How do we use exploratory visualization as a research method in the humanities and social science? How to understand visualization theoretically in relation to other visual media, past and present?

> This course explores the possibilities, the methods, and the tools for working with large cultural data sets, with a particular focus on data visualization and the analysis of visual media (images and video). It also covers relevant work from digital art and design, media theory and software studies...

In the past we have had to do that triangulation by hand, and so making these connections is often a laborious and imperfect process. With each passing week, more and more historical data appears online marked up in ways that make it possible for us to use new software tools to work with these data. Now software can make connections for us and possibly even propose new ways of thinking about things such as relationships between individuals.[3] As Greg Crane pointed out several years ago, 
>“Already the books in a digital library are beginning to read one another and to confer among themselves before creating a new synthetic document for review by their human readers.”

The progress made by the open data movement is pretty extraordinary. A few years ago, data was something that only statisticians cared about, but today it is one of the most vibrant areas of exploration and innovation.

Data mining is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
